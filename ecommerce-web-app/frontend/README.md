# E-commerce Web Application

This is an e-commerce web application built with a Node.js backend and a React frontend. The application allows users to browse products, view product details, and manage their shopping cart.

## Frontend

The frontend is developed using React and is responsible for rendering the user interface. It communicates with the backend to fetch product data and handle user interactions.
